            <Description>
                Single blocks, generously scattered through all heights (density is about that of vanilla iron ore). 
                They will replace dirt and sandstone (but not grass or sand), so they can be found nearer 
                to the surface than most ores.  Intened to be used as a child distribution for large, rare strategic 
                deposits that would otherwise be very difficult to find.
                Note that the frequency is multiplied by ground level to maintain a constant density, but not by
                ore frequency because it is assumed that the frequency of the parent distribution will already
                be scaled by that.

            <Description>
                Large veins filled very lightly with ore.  Because they contain less ore per volume, 
                these veins are relatively wide and long.  Mining the ore from them is time consuming 
                compared to solid ore veins.  They are also more difficult to follow, since it is 
                harder to get an idea of their direction while mining.
